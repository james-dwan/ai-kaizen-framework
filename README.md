# AI Jidoka Framework

**Human-AI Collaborative Kaizen for Agentic Systems**

**Author:** James Dwan, Catalyst Consulting · MIT License

Embed daily improvement katas, Jidoka exception management, SQDIP metrics,
5 Whys root cause analysis, and FMEA thinking into
[LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph)-based agentic workflows —
with a shared Kanban board as the workspace where humans and AI solve problems
together.

## Philosophy

AI Jidoka is the practice of intelligent human-machine partnership — where AI
and humans work together with shared awareness, perform daily improvement
katas, conduct root cause analysis, and continuously evolve both the automated
process and human standard work. The focus is on true collaboration, not
automation with occasional human oversight.

## What you get

| Lean concept | In the framework |
|---|---|
| **Jidoka** (stop on abnormality) | Business-editable rules watch every node; at high severity the graph routes to an `andon` node and stops before defects flow downstream |
| **Make problems visible** | Every abnormality becomes a structured Kanban ticket with a 5 Whys scaffold and a countermeasure checklist |
| **SQDIP** | Safety, Quality, Delivery, Inventory, Productivity computed daily from the run log, scored against your targets |
| **Daily Kaizen kata** | A Reflection Agent prepares the daily summary and improvement suggestions; humans and AI review it together |
| **FMEA** | A registry of anticipated failure modes, ranked by RPN, folded into the daily reflection |
| **Sensei coaching** | A Sensei Agent reviews 5 Whys analyses socratically — questioning vague problem statements, blame-the-person causes, and weak countermeasures. Questions, never answers |
| **Standard work as a living agreement** | One versioned YAML file holds rules, prompts, targets, *and* human standard work — editable without code changes, archived on every save |
| **Safe experimentation** | Sandbox mode logs everything but creates no tickets and takes no external actions; config versioning makes every change reversible |

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/james-dwan/ai-jidoka-framework.git
cd ai-jidoka-framework
pip install -e .

cd examples/professional-services-invoicing
python invoicing_workflow.py     # watch the line stop on bad data
python run_daily_kaizen.py       # generate the daily Kaizen summary
```

## Minimal usage

```python
from typing import TypedDict
from kaizen import KaizenConfig, KaizenGraphBuilder
from kaizen.kaizen_graph import KaizenState

class MyState(KaizenState, TypedDict, total=False):
    orders: list
    total: float

def collect(state): ...
def process(state): ...

config = KaizenConfig.load("config/kaizen_config.yaml")

builder = KaizenGraphBuilder(MyState, config)
builder.add_node("collect", collect)
builder.add_node("process", process)
builder.set_entry_point("collect")
builder.add_edge("collect", "process")
builder.set_finish_point("process")

graph = builder.compile()
result = graph.invoke({})

if result["kaizen_stopped"]:
    print("Andon:", result["kaizen_stop_reason"])
```

Abnormality rules live in the config, not the code:

```yaml
rules:
  - name: order-total-out-of-range
    description: Order total exceeds the auto-approval threshold
    condition: "state.get('total', 0) > 25000"
    severity: high          # high => Jidoka stop
    sqdip_category: safety
    nodes: [process]
```

The daily reflection:

```python
from kaizen import KaizenConfig, ReflectionAgent, RunLog, create_board, build_default_llm

config = KaizenConfig.load("config/kaizen_config.yaml")
agent = ReflectionAgent(
    config=config,
    runlog=RunLog(),
    board=create_board(config.kanban),
    llm=build_default_llm(),   # optional: Claude writes the narrative
)
summary = agent.daily_reflection()   # SQDIP + exceptions + suggestions -> board
```

## Kanban providers

The board is the shared workspace, so it should live where your team already
works. Microsoft 365 is first-class; the core works with anything.

- **`local`** (default) — a JSON file; zero configuration, ideal for
  development and sandbox experiments
- **`planner`** — Microsoft Planner via Microsoft Graph
  (`pip install 'ai-jidoka-framework[m365]'`)
- **`lists`** — Microsoft Lists (SharePoint) via Microsoft Graph
- Anything else — implement the three-method `KanbanBoard` ABC

Authentication stays in your hands: pass any `token_provider` callable (device
code, client secret, managed identity — whatever your tenant requires).

## Optional extras

```bash
pip install 'ai-jidoka-framework[m365]'   # Microsoft Planner / Lists boards
pip install 'ai-jidoka-framework[llm]'    # Claude-written daily reflections
pip install 'ai-jidoka-framework[dev]'    # tests + lint
```

## Repository layout

```
src/kaizen/
  kaizen_graph.py        # KaizenGraphBuilder — LangGraph + Jidoka
  exception_handler.py   # rules, ExceptionRecord, 5 Whys, FMEA
  reflection_agent.py    # SQDIP + daily Kaizen summaries
  kanban_integration.py  # local / Planner / Lists boards
  config.py              # versioned YAML config layer
  runlog.py              # append-only event log
docs/                    # white paper + architecture
examples/professional-services-invoicing/
```

## Sensei coaching

```python
from kaizen import KaizenConfig, SenseiAgent, create_board

config = KaizenConfig.load("config/kaizen_config.yaml")
sensei = SenseiAgent(config)                    # add llm=... for richer questions
sensei.coach_open_exceptions(create_board(config.kanban))
# Every open exception ticket now carries socratic questions about its 5 Whys.
```

## Roadmap

- **Root cause investigations as flows.** Each exception ticket becomes its own
  long-running KaizenGraph: problem statement → data/Pareto → cause
  brainstorming (fishbone) → 5 Whys → countermeasure design → pilot → verify →
  standardize, checkpointed across days with human input at each gate, and the
  Sensei Agent as the Jidoka layer on the *thinking* itself.
- **Specialist kata agents.** A roster of agents good at different jobs —
  problem-statement writing, Pareto analysis, fishbone facilitation, cause
  brainstorming, pilot design, team communications — orchestrated within the
  investigation flow.
- More Kanban providers (Trello, Jira, GitHub Projects) and SQDIP trend
  analysis across days.

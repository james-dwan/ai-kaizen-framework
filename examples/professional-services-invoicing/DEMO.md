# Live demo runbook — AI Jidoka Framework

~10 minutes end to end. Run everything from this folder with the virtualenv
active and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in the repo-root `.env`.

```bash
cd examples/professional-services-invoicing
source ../../.venv/bin/activate        # or your own venv with `pip install -e '..[llm]'`
```

To reset between rehearsals:

```bash
rm -f kaizen_board.json kaizen_runlog.jsonl kaizen_dashboard.html && rm -rf kaizen_reports
```

## Act 1 — Jidoka: the line stops itself (~1 min)

```bash
python invoicing_workflow.py
```

**What happens:** the monthly invoicing run hits deliberately faulty data — a
consultant who never submitted a report, a negative-hours timesheet, an
engagement with no rate card. Two medium exceptions become tickets and the run
*continues*; the missing rate card is high severity and **stops the line**
before a bad invoice is raised.

**Say:** "Nothing here asked a human for permission to stop. The process
detected its own abnormality, made it visible as tickets, and refused to pass
a defect downstream. That's Jidoka."

Optional beat: `python invoicing_workflow.py --sandbox` — same stops, no
tickets, no side effects. "This is how the team trials rule changes safely."

## Act 2 — The daily kata: AI prepares, humans interpret (~2 min)

```bash
python run_daily_kaizen.py --llm
```

**What happens:** Claude computes SQDIP from the run log, reads the exception
patterns, and writes the daily Kaizen summary — posted to the shared board as
the standup agenda.

**Point at:** the SQDIP table (red across the board — and the narrative
correctly says Delivery failure is the root symptom, not five separate
problems); the closing question to the team. "The AI doesn't decide — it
prepares the conversation."

## Act 3 — The investigation: an A3 as a flow (~5 min)

```bash
python run_investigation.py --llm
```

Pick the **missing-rate-card** ticket. Every stage pauses for you — the human
gates are non-optional. Suggested inputs (finish each answer with an empty
line):

| Stage | What to type |
|---|---|
| `frame_problem` | `In the 2026-07 run, 88.0 hours on ENG-004 could not be billed because no rate card entry exists; standard is 100% of delivered hours billable at cutoff.` |
| `collect_data` | `Checked the CRM: ENG-004 was created 2026-07-02 by sales; the commercial setup task is still sitting in the finance queue.` |
| `brainstorm_causes` | `ok` (look at Claude's drafted fishbone first — it's grounded in your observation) |
| `five_whys` — **round 1, on purpose:** | `The person who set up the engagement forgot the rate card` ⏎ `Human error` |

**The moment:** the Sensei refuses to accept it and sends you back with
socratic questions — "what in the *process* allowed a normal human action to
become a defect?" **Say:** "The AI just rejected blame as a root cause. It
gates the quality of the thinking, not just the data."

| Stage | What to type |
|---|---|
| `five_whys` — round 2: | `Hours for ENG-004 could not be billed` ⏎ `ENG-004 has no entry in the rate card` ⏎ `The engagement was activated in the CRM before commercial setup finished` ⏎ `CRM activation and rate-card creation are separate manual steps with no dependency` ⏎ `The onboarding process has no gate that blocks activation until the rate card exists` ⏎ `Engagement onboarding lacks a completeness gate before activation` |
| `design_countermeasure` | `countermeasure: add a CRM validation rule - an engagement cannot move to Active until a rate card entry exists` ⏎ `pilot: enable the rule for new engagements only for two weeks in sandbox; measure missing-rate-card exceptions` |
| `verify` | `yes: two weeks piloted, zero missing-rate-card exceptions on new engagements` |

**What happens:** the gate opens (READY), the full A3 is printed and written
back to the ticket, and the ticket closes — but only because the pilot was
verified.

## Optional act — the interactive board (~2 min)

```bash
python serve_board.py --llm      # opens http://127.0.0.1:8765
```

A live board over the same tickets: **drag** a ticket from Open to In progress,
**click** it to edit the 5 Whys right in the description, **add a note** (your
half of the conversation), then hit **"Ask the Sensei"** — it re-reads your
analysis and replaces its questions section in place. Answer the questions,
ask again, and watch it move from questions to "ready to act on."

**Say:** "Locally this is a JSON file; in production these exact interactions
happen in Microsoft Planner — the agents don't care which board it is."

## Act 4 — The dashboard (~1 min)

```bash
python make_dashboard.py
```

**Point at:** SQDIP tiles vs targets, the exception Pareto ("where should the
next investigation go?"), the board with the investigated ticket now done, and
the daily report. **Close:** "One versioned YAML file holds the rules, the
prompts, the targets, and the humans' standard work. The team improves this
system daily — that loop, not the automation, is the product."

## If something goes wrong

- **No/invalid API key:** everything still runs — `--llm` degrades to the
  deterministic summaries with a visible note. The demo cannot crash on auth.
- **Weird LLM output:** re-run the command; or drop `--llm` and narrate the
  deterministic version (it makes the same structural points).
- **Muscle-memory reset:** the `rm` line at the top restores a clean state in
  one second.

"""The Sensei Agent — a socratic coach for root cause analysis.

A Lean sensei never gives the answer; they ask the question that makes the
team see the gap themselves. This agent reviews 5 Whys analyses (from
exception tickets or directly) and raises socratic questions when the analysis
shows classic anti-patterns:

- vague, unmeasurable problem statements
- causal chains that stop at a symptom
- "blame the person" instead of "interrogate the process"
- weak countermeasures (reminders, training, "be more careful")
- root causes that merely restate the problem

Like the Reflection Agent, it works deterministically out of the box; give it
a LangChain chat model and the questions become richer and more contextual.

This is the first of what may become a roster of specialist kata agents
(problem-statement writer, Pareto analyst, fishbone facilitator, pilot
designer, team communicator). The Sensei comes first because it protects the
quality of the thinking the others depend on.
